# Wallets and Types of Accounts
Every collaborator has a wallet with **primary**, **social**, and **elective** accounts. 

Optionally, the collaborator may choose to become involved with sovereign leadership / projects or elective leadership / projects, which will grant them access to additional accounts, depending on their role.

## Key Points of Wallets and Accounts 
- Two Types of Accounts 
	- **Active** Holds spendable ∑
	- **Passive** Redirects received ∑ to a list of accounts
- Each **Collaborator** has 3 accounts
	- **Primary** (Checking Account ) [Active]
	- **Elective** (Sends ∑ to Elective Projects) [Passive]
	- **Social** (Sends ∑ to Social Projects) [Passive]
- Each **Project** has 3 accounts
	- **Payroll** account (Sends ∑ to Employees)[Passive]
	- **Do** Account (To complete stated goals) [Active]
	- **Be** Account (To grow / Improve project itself) [Active]
- **Earth Collective ** has 3 accounts
	- **Plenty** Account (Deposits 144 ∑ Daily in each of every individual's 3 accounts)
	- **Integration** Account has a set limit of ∑ available for purchase

#   Accounts
## Active Accounts
Active accounts hold Effective. These accounts operate much like a checking account or cryptocurrency wallet. 

If one overdrafts the account won't be charged a fee, they will be lent the effective and the transaction completed. 

If one cannot borrow more effective, the transaction will be declined. Borrowing is detailed fully in a later section. 



## Passive Accounts
Passive accounts redirect effective in the same moment it is received to either another passive account or an active account. 

Passive accounts can specify up to 144 addresses to send their currency. Passive accounts can only redirect Effective to specified types of accounts. {Is this true?}

will be given 144 Effective (∑) per day in their Primary Account, which operates like a checking account. 


## Hybrid Accounts
Any Active account **can operate** as a passive account at, the discretion of the account owner / director. Active accounts can operate as passive accounts anywhere from 1/144 to 144/144 with no restrictions to where the ∑ is sent. Any active or passive account can be the recipient, except the sending account itself. 

Passive accounts **cannot** act as active accounts, as they are not equipped to hold ∑

Examples of Hybrid Use-cases  
- Individuals paying off debt
- Projects fulfilling contractual obligations
- Social projects aimed at distributing supplemental income

y will not be charged a fee, they will be lent the effective and the transaction completed. 

If the user cannot borrow more effective, the transaction will be declined.
