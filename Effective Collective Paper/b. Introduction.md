We propose a socioeconomic system based on voluntary collaboration to run the biggest collective efforts, the economy and communities, as **collaborative coordinators**, in harmony with humanity and nature. This is in opposition to many modern social structures which operate on competition.

In political elections, we have **one winner**, and several losers, often in an unnecessarily cumbersome ways. In capitalistic economies, the companies that survive and increase their capital and returns are the "winners". Unfortunately, in both of these systems the individuals and planet Earth pays the price, manipulated and mutilated in order for corporations and politicians to continue to "win".

**Competition** creates **dissonance** and **imbalance**, as one side is always more powerful than the other, which creates a constant struggle. 

Collaboration creates harmony and resonance with the Earth, Solar system, Galaxy, and our own internal universe.

Balance can be created by introducing another, independent layer of energy exchange where freely-distributed currency is summed together by intentional, collaborative citizens to be used for the harmonious mutual benefit of the **individual**, the **collective**, and **Gaia**. 

This layer of energy exchange is not designed to fix or replace any system, financial, governmental, societal, or otherwise. It is designed to enhance the fidelity of all of these things, from the viewpoints of the individual, human collective, and Gaia. 

## Collaborative requirements
Each individual (collaborator) should be able to claim the same amount of **collaborative power** once per day, represented by digital currency. 

This digital currency should be a cryptocurrency tradable for other cryptocurrencies and FIAT. Each collaborator should also be given a daily amount of cryptocurrency to spend, gift, and trade with.

The portion of this digital currency distribution pegged for collaboration should be redirected to elective projects, or to leaders who support social projects related to a geographically-bound collective (Town, nation, etc). Which  s and leaders the currency goes to should be chosen before the currency is received, and published in a pseudo-anonymous list. This list of recipients should be able to be changed at any time, but only by the collaborator themselves. 

This system will allow any number of individual collaborators to pool their freely-given resources together to support projects that seek to create meaningful change in themselves, the collective and Gaia. 

Projects seeking collaborators should be expressed in a **proposal** that follows a standard format. 

Any collaborator should be able to easily see these proposals, and compare them through visual and textual representations of the proposed stakeholders, requirements and intended impact.

Periodically, projects should automatically publish a **report** giving facts about how funds were spent. This report should display transaction history visually. Project leaders can use this opportunity to update any changes to their proposal, or add relevant information to the report, such as which goals were fulfilled, changes to existing goals, and new goals. 

Every project that has collaborators will receive funds in this system, no matter if two individuals are collaborating or two million. Funding amount is equal to the number of individuals collaborating multiplied by their desire to collaborate on one project more than another. 

Each collaborator should be able to choose a large, but not infinite, number of projects to support. They should be able to choose what proportion of their support goes to each project.

Finally, pseudo-anonymity should be applied to leader candidates, so collaborators consider the leader's list of supported projects, not their name. Pseudo-anonymity should also be applied to the collaborators themselves so that data can be public without being tied to an actual person. This anonymity should operate at all levels of the system, so no one has access to a list of the collaborators choices, nor who the candidates are. 


## Introduction Summary

In this paper, we describe a system called **Effective Collective** that allows individuals to focus collectively to create desired change in themselves, the human collective, and Gaia. This system is modeled on abundance and collaboration, and values individuals' opinions while also rewarding them for participating.
