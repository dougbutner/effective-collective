Effective uses a base-12 numeric system, which has been converted into base-10 for this paper.  

> This train of ideas hasn't been re-picked up since 2020. Final goal new symbols for a Base-12 system

# Reasoning for Base-12
12 can be easily divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 without resorting to complex decimals. Because one ∑ cannot be sub-divided, this is highly beneficial. 

144 has even more useful divisors, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72,  and 144. 

This allows [delgated stake] to be easily understood and displayed graphically. 

It is a general desire of the founders of this project to use base-12 whenever the opportunity arises. 



# New-meric Symbols
Below is a recommendation for new symbols to represent the base 12 numeric system. 

# Base-12 Symbol Recommendation

Any user interface for an effective wallet should have the option for both displays. 

# Terms & Slang 
Square - The amount of ∑ that a person receives per day in each wallet account (144) is called a "square" and may be visualized as such. This is useful for explaining quickly how much something may cost. If there is a housing project that costs 72∑ per day, it can be said to cost 1/2 square
