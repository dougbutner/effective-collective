Here is a short introduction to the actors that work together to create the Effective system. 

Detailed explanations of each actor are given in the following sections. 


# Overview

## What is Effective
Effective is a **collaborative economy** that works by giving people **daily currency** to (1) spend or save, (2) put towards social services and (3) support elective projects. The **sum** of every person's contribution is **given to projects** in a public registry **to complete the project's stated objectives**. 

## Key Points of Effective
- **Free digital currency** (∑) distributed daily
	- Daily, each person gets 432∑ split three ways: 
		- For **themselves** (144∑)
		- For **Social projects** where they live (144∑)
		- For **Elective projects** they choose (144∑) 
- Goal is to harmonize **Individual**, **Collective** and **Gaia**
- **Transparent Projects** & Democratic **Social Leadership** 
- People must be **verified** and only hold one account
	- Verification is not linked to Gov ID, but hashed biometric data
	- Biometric data unrecoverable from hash, but can be used to ensure only one account per person
- Three "**wallets**" Per Person (Same as Mentioned Earlier)
	- Debit-like **spending account**
	- Editable passive list of **supported elective projects**
	- Editable supported **social leaders** list
- **Social projects** provide free public services
	- Citizens choose public leaders anonymously based on lists of social projects they support
	- **Funding** directed by social leaders' **public lists**
	- **Global**, **National**, **Region**, **District**, & **City** levels
- **Elective projects** Funding for any type of project
	- May be **public**, or **private**
	- May be **locational** (e.g. housing), or **non-locational** (e.g. app)
	- May **reward** collaborators by amount contributed (e.g. Sandwich shop)
- Every actor stored in on **blockchain**, with human-actors pseudo-anonymous
	- **Projects**' components and financial reporting
	- **Leaders**' supported social projects
	- **Individuals'** supported elective projects and social leaders


## Guiding Vision
The objective of effective is to harmonize the **individual**, the **human collective**, and **Gaia**. The **individual** is every human on the planet, a sum of Body, Mind, and Spirit. The **collective** is the sum of every human consciousness, as well as smaller collectives (self-identified groups, communities, families, etc). 

### Clarification
**Gaia** is the sum of every form of life on this planet, including all plant and animal life and elemental life (Elements, and elemental collectives like Air, Water, Fire, Earth, etc). The **human collective** is the sum of the human energy, emotion, and thought. The **individual** is any humanoid Earth resident. 

# Effective Actors
## Collaborator (individual)
A collaborator is an individual who controls an Effective recipient address. Collaborators are represented as an array of three objects which correspond to their Wallet, **Social Leader List**, and **Elective Project list**. 

**A person can only have one wallet**, and **a wallet can only be owned by a living person who has reached the age of 12 (or 18)**. Identity verification and hibernation / deletion of inactive wallets are used to achieve this goal. 

## Projects
A project is a published set of relationships organizing people around a common desire, goal, or manifestation . The most important relationships are project facilitators to each other / the manifestation, and the relationship of the project's supporters to team. 

 creates something, transforms something, or uses tools and collaborator's time to complete tasks. 


## Collectives
Collectives are groups of individuals with common geographic ties sharing their choice on what projects to nourish in the Effective ecosystem. For the purposes of EC, collectives exist at 6 levels, World, Nation, State, County, City, Community. Collaborators can join one collective at each level. Choosing a "city" locks in all other levels, but a person could choose to operate at a higher level, ignoring lower levels.




## Gaia
To harmonize with Gaia, we have a garden fund that is used to purchase land for conservation, and reclaim and regenerate land through public permaculture. 



An account can be **Active** or **Passive**

**Active** accounts can transact like any other cryptocurrency wallet. 

**Passive** accounts pass on received currency a list of addresses.

## Accounts
### Collaborator Accounts
- Can hold & transfer ∑ (active) ∑ OR Can automatically redirect received ∑ to another accounts (passive)
- Can be owned by a person 
- Can be controlled by a project

### Project Accounts
- Controlled by the founders of the account, through a multisig or one founder. 

## Currency 
The digital currency is called [Sum] and represented by ∑. 

Name Ideas: Sol, Lyra, Note, Tone, Atom, Effective, Sum, Epsilon

We are greater than the Sum of our parts. 

## Projects

Social, Commercial, and Personal projects exist to unite people around a common goal. Projects have deliverables, timeframes, an update publishing protocol, and supporters. 


## Data Storage, transfer and Encapsulation
All parts of the system exist in JSON (Javascript Object Notation) format. Data is serialized for performance on-chain. Markdown documents stored on IPFS and hashed on-chain may be used for larger data, 

# Data integrity through Capsulation
The entire system could be encapsulated into a single Json object at any time. This object would have all the information to keep the system running at a certain state to infinity. Thus, by capturing this object periodically, we can have a record of the entire system. This record can be used to graphically display state and changes across the entire system, or by time or geographic searching.
