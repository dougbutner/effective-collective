# Verified Individuality


## Key Points
- **One individual** (person) per account, enforced through verification
- Every individual resident of Earth can have an account, no restriction to gender, nationality, terms with any government or list of individuals
- Age 12 is the minimum age to open an account 
- Every individual is given equal ∑, therefore, equal power
- Every individual has sole control of their own ∑
	- Total control over ∑ in Active account
	- Control of recipient lists for passive accounts
- An individual is not associated with a name, or government ID 
- An individual is associated with multi-point biometric data OR can be socially verified (TBD)
- Account is a 6-digit base-60 ID, which can be changed any time for a 12∑ fee paid to the Earth Collective's Garden account.


## Verified Individuality Overview
First and foremost, a person's name, government ID, or any other ID should never be stored or even asked by the verification system. This ensures each individuals equality in the eyes of Effective. 

Each individual must have equal collaborative power and opportunities. There are no special privileges, economically or socially, for system founders, wealth holders, etc, outside of the Council of Elders, Project leaders, and Social Leaders.

The only required user-supplied data points are date of birth, and home city / town. Home city is used to determine which social leaders they are able to support, and where that support goes. 

Birth date is needed because each person must be over the age of 12 to get an account. This age is chosen because it is when the brain starts making beta waves, implying the individual can start making critical decisions for their community.

## System Integrity
All of these must be maintained for the integrity of the system
 - One Earthling per account
 - Impossible for another person to change account without true owner's knowledge
 - No government-registered identity information, nor Effective account information should be stored with the biometric data. Any biometric data shouldn't be able to be re-constructed from the stored 

## Biometric VS Social Verification
To prove individuality, two solutions come to the forefront. One is to use biometric data in the 

## Biometric Account Recovery
As the biometric record is only able to check whether or not someone is already on the system, it can be used to recover a wallet by matching an incoming request with an existing account. 

For example, if your MetaMask wallet holding your Effective is compromised, you would normally lose all of your currency and control of your account. However, with biometric unlocking, you are your recovery phrase.

This would not protect someone from spending all the Effective you have in your Metamask's active account, but it would protect against them gaining control of the account forever, and when you recover the account, you would again receive the Effective daily to build back up your savings. 

This system must take into account young people that are growing, and who's voice or other biometric information may change considerably by requiring an update periodically. 

Biometric information should hashed in a way that it can never be recreated from the hash, as this will be stored on chain, but can be used to verify a possible match when presented a set of biometric data. In this way, the information can only be used to say "Yes, this is the correct person, or No, this is not the correct person" and check whether a person exists already on the system, as needed to open an account. 

The alternative to a data-driven biometric approach is to have a 

## Biometric Logistics
Creating this biometric system is crucial for the success of Effective, and presents the biggest logistical challenge. Protecting users biometric information in a system without trust is paramount, and requires a hard look at harnessing available algorithms, identifying minimal representative data points, and hashing data in verifiable yet unrecoverable ways. 

To this end, a sizable amount of the funding received for this project will go towards opening bounties for programmers who can solve these storage problems for several points of biometric data, as well as the corresponding data collection problems implied.
