# Abstract

Effective Collective facilitates collaboration in the **funding of social and elective projects through collective choice**. 

**Individuals become collaborators** by registering for a free digital wallet which automatically receives three equal deposits of Effective daily into three accounts.

144 - Community + Sovereign 
144 - Elective
144 - Primary
= 432 per individual per day 

The first deposit goes to a **Sovereign Account**, and is redirected towards leaders who support projects related to the geopolitical areas the person lives. The second goes to an **Elective Account**, and is redirected directly towards any project they desire to support. The third goes to a **Primary Account** and is spendable in the ecosystem, and also tradable as a TELOS token.
