# Effective operates with a currency called Sum with the symbol ∑

Effective (∑) is a token built for the EOSIO ecosystem. 
One unit and of Effective is called a Sum, which can be shortened to ∑

Can be said as Sum 24 

(possibly rename to Epsilon)

One piece unit of Effective is called a Sum, which can be shortened to ∑

## Claiming Sum Tokens

The algorithm offers users up to their current owed amount by a claim action. This action will always pay the user all of their ∑. 

## Inflation
Maximum Inflation in EC is a product of the total population, and a fixed and always known number (432) per day. 

 Max Yearly Inflation = Authenticated Users x 432 ∑ x 365 days

### Scaling + Predictable Inflation Rate
This makes an economic model that is predictable, with inflation known and reasonably estimable in the future. 


## Loans
A user can borrow ∑ if if it known that the system will pay them an amount in the future. Any person can, generally, borrow up to half their owed ∑ value for the next 30 days. Repayments are automatic and unstoppable, so all loans get paid. All system loans are 0% APR, free loans. Furthermore, if a user tries to transact within the system contracts, the loan should be automatic.
